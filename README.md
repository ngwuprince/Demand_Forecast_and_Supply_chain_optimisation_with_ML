Machine Learning Process in Demand Forecasting for Supply Chain Optimization
Demand forecasting is a critical process in supply chain management, involving the prediction of future customer demand using historical data and statistical techniques. Accurate demand forecasts enable companies to optimize inventory levels, reduce holding costs, and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability.

In supply chain optimization, demand forecasting helps:

Inventory Management: By predicting demand, companies can maintain optimal stock levels, avoiding overstocking and stockouts.
Resource Allocation: Efficiently allocate resources like labor, storage space, and transportation.
Production Planning: Schedule production runs to meet anticipated demand, reducing idle time and maximizing efficiency.
Cost Reduction: Minimize costs associated with excess inventory, storage, and obsolete stock.
Features in the Dataset:

Temperature (Celsius): The temperature on the corresponding date, which may influence demand for certain products (e.g., hot weather may increase demand for cold beverages).
Rainfall (mm): The amount of rainfall on the corresponding date, which can affect demand for outdoor products or activities.
Day of Week: The day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday), which may exhibit different demand patterns due to weekly cycles or work schedules.
Holiday: A binary indicator (Yes/No) indicating whether the date is a holiday, as demand may vary significantly on holidays compared to regular days.
These features demonstrate how to incorporate various external factors into demand forecasting models to improve accuracy and performance.
